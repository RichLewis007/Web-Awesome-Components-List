# Web Awesome Components List

Hi,
 I've written up what I think is a comprehensive list of all components in the Web Awesome library, both Free and Pro, completed and upcoming. I've put them in several lists which include the components alphabeticized, categorized, and merged and categorized.

[Click here to see my writeup of the components](https://github.com/RichLewis007/Web-Awesome-Components-List/blob/main/Web%20Awesome%20Components%20Lists.md).

If this might be helpful to you in the future, be sure to start this repo. That will also help other people see it.

If you see any errors, let me know!
