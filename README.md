# 👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿 Web Awesome Components List 👍🏻👍🏼👍

I've written up a comprehensive list of all components in the Web Awesome library, both Free and Pro, completed and upcoming. I've put them in several lists which include the components alphabeticized, categorized, and merged and categorized. You can also get them Scattered, Smothered, Covered, Chunked, Diced, Peppered, Capped, Topped, or Country. If you order the extra Pro components, you can have them "All The Way!" [‡](#page-notes) 

> **What Is Web Awesome?**
> 
>**A major open‑source library**: Web Awesome bills itself as "the biggest open‑source library of meticulously designed, highly customizable, and framework‑agnostic UI components."
> 
>**Framework‑agnostic**: You can drop these components into plain HTML pages or integrate them seamlessly into frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.
> 
>**Built on modern standards**: The components are built with [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) and Google's [LitElement](https://lit.dev/docs/) lightweight library, ensuring they're native, modular, and performant.
>
>**Accessibility and customization**: Designed to be accessible, fully themeable, and easily tuned to match your brand or style preferences.

##### Page Notes
<sub>‡ References to the </sub>🧇<sub> **Waffle House restaurant**, which allows you to customize hash browns using a specific lingo to add toppings or ingredients, such as Scattered (spread thin), Smothered (with onions), Covered (with cheese), Chunked (with ham), Diced (with tomatoes), Peppered (with jalapeños), Capped (with mushrooms), Topped (with chili), or Country (with gravy). You can also combine these options and order your hash browns **All the Way**, which includes everything for the ultimate hash brown experience.</sub>\
<sub>**All the Way**: "World Famous Golden Delicious Hashbrowns with Grilled Onions, Melted American Cheese, Hickory Smoked Ham, Diced Tomatoes, Jalapeno Peppers & Grilled Mushrooms, then topped with Bert`s Chili™ and Sausage Gravy." Waffle House food must be purchased separately from Web Awesome Pro. Sadly.</sub>\
